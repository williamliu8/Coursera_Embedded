This course is focused on giving you real world coding experience and hands on project work with ARM based Microcontrollers.

You will learn:
How to implement software configuration management.
Developing embedded software applications.

Course assignments include:
Creating a build system using the GNU Toolchain GCC
Using Git version control
Developing software in Linux on a Virtual Machine.
Creating your own build system and firmware that can manipulate memory.

The second course in this 2 course series:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/embedded-software-hardware
Embedded Software and Hardware Architecture will use hardware tools to program and debug microcontrollers with bare-metal firmware.
Using a Texas Instruments MSP432 Development Kit you will:
Configuring a variety of peripherals
Writing numerous programs,and see your work execute on your own embedded platform!

I enjoy these 2 classes vary much, and have got certificates of these 2 classes with full grade.
